## Why is this useful?
When you're developing a software in C that allows viewing, selecting, loading and creating files, you may also want to offer the functionality to delete files. Using POSIX specified functions for cross-platform development may seem sensible, however `remove()` and `rmdir()` happen to permanently delete files and directories. This is likely not the behavior a user of your program would expect even more so if there aren't any warnings. In order to ease development of cross-platform C applications, this library implements the soft delete functionality for you. It also helps with operating systems where the C interface isn't well documented, like for instance with Windows' `IFileOperation` interface.

## How does the library implement a trashcan?
For Linux and *BSD the library implements the [FreeDesktop.org trash specification v1.0](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-1.0.html). On Windows our implementation uses the `IFileOperation` interface and also handles COM initialization. MacOS already has a simple way to trash files using the `NSFileManager` which is wrapped in a function as well. 

## API
The function `int trashcan_soft_delete(const char *path)` is provided on all platforms. It takes a path to a file or directory, tries to move it to the trashcan and returns a status code. Additional platform dependent functions with different signatures are provided, e.g. to control COM initialization on Windows. The complete API is documented in the [trashcan.h](src/trashcan.h) file. For an example application that uses libtrashcan take a look at [example.c](example.c).

All functions for soft deletion return a status code which can be converted into a status message using `const char* trashcan_status_msg(int status_code)`. Any status code other than zero means that an error has occured.

## Compilation
In order to use libtrashcan you need to include `trashcan.h` in your source code, build and link the library. An example project is provided that shows how to accomplish this with CMake. Using CMake is *not a requirement* for your project you can use any build tools you prefer. 
If you build your own application on macOS and don't use our provided CMakeLists.txt, then you need to link and include the header files of CoreFoundation and Cocoa as well.

The example project is a CLI application that takes a path to a file or directory as argument and tries to move it to the trash. It can be build by executing the following commands on your terminal/shell/command line if you have CMake and a compiler is installed:

```
mkdir build
cd ./build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
